First, everyone writes down a few words or phrases on "cards" that will be guessed later. The group will then randomly be split into two teams!

Players from each team will alternate turns, giving clues to their team to guess as many cards as possible against the clock. There'll be 3 rounds, and cards will get recycled after each round!

-   Round 1: Taboo. Use words to describe the word or phrase on the card, without any acting or gestures. You cannot use any part of the word or phrase!
-   Round 2: Charades. Without words or sounds, act and use gestures to communicate the word or phrase on the card.
-   Round 3: Password. You can say exactly one word to describe the word or phrase on the card, no more! You'll rely on your team's memory and association.

The team that guesses the most cards across all rounds wins!
