**In each round:**

1.  Without communicating, everyone writes a one-word clue.

    -   *valid:* proper nouns, numbers, acronyms, onomatopoeia.
    -   *invalid:* translations or homophones of the word, invented words.

2.  Everyone compares clues, hiding clues that are identical.

    -   Tap the "Hide" button beside a clue to hide it.
    -   After everyone's decided what to hide, tap the "Show Clues" button.

3.  The guesser guesses the word.

    -   Tap the "Show" button to show a clue, even during or after guessing.
    -   After guessing, the guesser can choose to guess again.
    -   Anyone can start the next round.

4.  Keep playing for as long as you want!

**Tips:**

-   If you disconnect, joining with the exact same name puts you back.
-   If someone leaves for real, you can kick them.
