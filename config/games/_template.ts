       By default, rocketcrab will automatically apply some params to playerURL like so:

       https://yourgame.com/?rocketcrab=true&name=Mary&ishost=true&code=abcd

       If you need those values to have different key names, use renameParams. For example,
       the below renameParams will make the above look like this instead:

       https://yourgame.com/?boosterfish=true&nickname=Mary&admin=true&gamecode=abcd

       You don't need to include all of them; just the ones you need.
